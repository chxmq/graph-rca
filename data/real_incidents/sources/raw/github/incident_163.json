  "description": "On September 20, 2023, a service disruption affected a subset of customers across multiple services beginning at 14:48 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). As a result, some customers were unable to login and access their services. A policy change executed as a part of our standard security controls review and update cycle to be the trigger of this incident. This change inadvertently blocked access to resources beyond its intended scope.",
