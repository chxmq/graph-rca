  "description": "Steam's desktop client deleted all local files and directories. The thing I find most interesting about this is that, after this blew up on social media, there were widespread reports that this was reported to Valve months earlier. But Valve doesn't triage most bugs, resulting in an extremely long time-to-mitigate, despite having multiple bug reports on this issue.",
