  "description": "Filestore enforces a global limit on API requests to limit impact in overload scenarios. The outage was triggered when an internal Google service managing a large number of GCP projects malfunctioned and overloaded the Filestore API with requests, causing global throttling of the Filestore API. This continued until the internal service was manually paused. As a result of this throttling, read-only API access was unavailable for all customers. This affected customers in all locations, due to a global quota that applies to Filestore. Console, gcloud and API access (List, GetOperation, etc.) calls all failed for a duration of 3 hours, 12 minutes. Mutate operations (CreateInstance, UpdateInstance, CreateBackup, etc.) still succeeded, but customers were unable to check on operation progress.",
