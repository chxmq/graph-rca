  "description": "An operator used a tool with lax input validation to reboot a small number of servers undergoing maintenance but forgot to type `-n` and instead rebooted all servers in the datacenter. This caused an outage that lasted 2.5 hours, rebooted all customer instances, put tremendous load on DHCP/TFTP PXE boot systems, and left API systems requiring manual intervention.
