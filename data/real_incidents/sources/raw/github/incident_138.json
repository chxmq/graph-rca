  "description": "A scripting bug caused the generation of the divider logic in the Pentium to very occasionally produce incorrect results. The bug wasn't caught in testing because of an incorrect assumption in a proof of correctness. (See [the Wikipedia article on 1994 FDIV bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentium_FDIV_bug) for more information.)",
